# ResNet50 model pretrained on ImageNet and removes the top classification layer. It adds a GlobalMaxPooling2D layer to obtain a fixed-size vector representation for each image.
# Defined a function named extract_features which will extract features from all training data set and store the results in variable normalized_result.
# Stored path of all the images in variable "filenames" with the help of os library.
# Stored all the features of training data in variable feature_list
# Created two folders named embeddings and fimenames in project to store the extracted features and filenames respectively. Used pickle library to do this.

# Stored the features and paths in two variables named feature_list and filenames.
# Used same ResNet50 model to extract features of new test image.
# Used K-NearestNeighbors to predict 5 closest images. Used euclidean distance.

# Used streamlit library to create a website.
# Created a folder named "uploads" in the project to store the new test image. Also displayed the image.
# Then used the features and paths stored in feature_list and filenames to predict the closest 5 images using KNN.
# Displayed those 5 images as well.
